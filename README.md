# Recommender-system-Movies
## Overview
This repository contains a Movie Recommender System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The project utilizes various recommendation techniques, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, to provide personalized movie recommendations.
## Features
* Data Processing: Cleans and preprocesses movie datasets for better recommendation accuracy.
* Recommendation Algorithms: Implements content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommendation models.
* User Interaction: Allows users to input movie preferences and receive personalized recommendations.
* Visualization: Displays movie recommendations and trends using data visualization techniques.
## Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable), Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Data Source: Publicly available movie datasets from Kaggle or other sources
## Usage
* Load the dataset and preprocess it.
* Train the recommendation model using one of the implemented algorithms.
* Provide user input (e.g., movie name or ratings) to receive recommendations.
* Visualize the recommended movies and trends.
## Dataset
The dataset includes:
* Movie Metadata: Title, genres, release year, cast, etc.
* User Interactions: Ratings, watch history, and preferences.
* Source: Available on Kaggle or other open data platforms.
## Future Enhancements
* Implement deep learning-based recommendations.
* Develop a web-based interface for easier interaction.
* Integrate with real-world movie databases (e.g., TMDb, IMDb API).
